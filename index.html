					<h3>Epsiode 1: Introduction and four chords</h3>
					<p>
						Talking about the start of this podcast and how to start music directing with a simple but popular four chord song.
						Scott explains the motivation behind the podcast, what you can expect to hear from future episodes, and how he got in to music
						direction in the first place - with the four chord song. If you can learn just four chords on any instrument, you can
						improvise a song!

						In our first guest interview, we talk with Gwen who has a degree in music pedagogy and is a cast member of 
						ImprovBoston's Family Show, an entirely improvised musical. Gwen discusses how we as performers can give ourselves a
